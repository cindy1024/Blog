# What is a Scientific Paper?

> "Interesting and unpublished" is equivalent to "non-existent".

## **Objective in research**

- to formulate
- to test hypotheses
- to draw conclusions from tests
- to tech conclusions to others

## A paper

- a structure for **planning** your research in progress
- not an archival device

## Write and rewrite plans

- beginning: plan
- end: outline
- continuous effort
    - to  **understand, analyze, summarize, and reformulate hypotheses** on paper

# Outlines

## A piece of paper

1. All important ideas
2. Questions:
    - Why did I do this work?
    - What does it mean?
    - What hypotheses did I mean to test?
    - What ones did I actually test?"
    - What were the results?
    - Did the work yield a new method of compound? What?
    - What measurements did I make?
    - What compounds? How were they characterized?
3. Sketch possible equations, figures, and schemes.

## Another piece of paper

1. Sort all of your ideas into three major heaps (1-3).
    - Introduction

        Why did I do the work? What were the central motivations and hypotheses?

    - Results and Discussion

        What were the results? How were compounds made and characterized? What was measured?

    - Conclusions

        What does it all mean? What hypotheses were proved or disproved? What did I learn? Why does it make a difference?

2. Organize each section on finer scale.

    Present the data clearly and compactly. (can be slow)

    - **figures, tables, and schemes**.
3. Put everything in good order. (in order of importance)
4. Give the outline to the supervisor. (4 to 5 iterations, often with additional experiments)
    - Input
        - where missing data will go
        - how I think they will look
        - how I will interpret them if the hypothesis is correct
    - Output: opinions, changes

**Start exchanging outlines and proposals as early as possible.**

## The outline

1. Title
2. Authors
3. Abstract
4. Introduction
    - Objective
    - Justification
    - Background
    - Guidance to the reader
    - Summary/conclusion
5. Results and Discussion
    - Headings
        - Subheadings
            - Figures (with captions)
            - Schemes (with captions and footnotes)
            - Equations
            - Tables (correctly formatted)
6. Conclusions

    A new, higher level of analysis, the significance of the work.

7. Experimental

# Some Points of Style

- **Do not use nouns as adjectives**.
- The word **"this"** mush always be followed by a noun.
- Describe **experimental results** in the **past** tense.
- Use the **active voice**.
- Complete all **comparisons**.
